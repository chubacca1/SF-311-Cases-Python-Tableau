# 311 Cases Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This GitHub repository hosts a data analysis and visualization project focused on 311 Cases data from data.sfgov.org. The primary goal of this project is to provide insights into the service requests and reports submitted by residents in San Francisco. The repository serves as both a learning resource and a work in progress.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Cleaning:** The project involves data cleaning to prepare the raw 311 Cases data for analysis. This includes handling unnecessary values, data type conversions, and creating new columns for enhanced insights.

- **Data Exploration:** After cleaning, the dataset is explored to identify patterns and trends. Statistics, charts, and graphs are used to uncover meaningful insights.

- **Data Transformation:** Data is transformed to facilitate visualization in Tableau. This may involve aggregation, reshaping, and creating calculated fields to derive additional information.

- **Visualization:** Interactive and informative data visualizations are created using Tableau.

- **Dashboard Creation:** Visualizations are organized into Tableau dashboards, providing a comprehensive view of the 311 Cases data.

- **Iterative Process:** This project is an ongoing endeavor, continuously improving data cleaning and visualization skills.

## Goals

- Gain proficiency in data cleaning techniques.
- Develop expertise in using Tableau for data visualization.
- Create meaningful and informative data visualizations.
- Learn from the iterative process of data analysis and visualization.
- Apply these skills to real-world datasets for future projects.

## Note

This repository is intended primarily for educational purposes. The results of data cleaning and visualization processes may evolve as part of the learning experience.
